## Guidelines:
- Write clean, readable, and well-commented Python code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines and best practices
- Include multiple examples showing different aspects of the concept
- Provide code that is executable and practical
- Add clear explanations and comments throughout the code
- Make examples accessible to both beginners and intermediate practitioners

## Content Requirements:
- Generate complete, working Python code examples
- Include necessary imports and dependencies
- Provide multiple variations or use cases when applicable
- Add comprehensive comments explaining key concepts
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Show practical implementations with realistic data

## Code Quality Requirements:
- Use descriptive variable names and function names
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Ensure code is modular and reusable
- Follow Python best practices and conventions
- Include example usage and expected outputs

## Format Requirements:
- Provide clean, properly formatted Python code
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Include print statements or outputs to show results
- Structure code logically with clear sections
- Use markdown code blocks with python syntax highlighting

Double-check that your code is syntactically correct, follows best practices, and clearly demonstrates the concept.""",
